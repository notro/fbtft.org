   Thanks to Derek Campbell (guzunty) there is now experimental DMA support for SPI in FBTFT.
   The CPU runs much lighter using DMA:  https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki/FPS#testing-with-dma-support

   * fb_ssd1351: added chip gpio support (backlight)
   * ads7846_device: moved to https://github.com/notro/fbtft_tools

- commit: f5fda53ad421799c7266310d87045cab0b525dec
  content: |
   * All drivers have been rewritten (except flexfb). They now contain only LCD Controller specific logic and a default init sequence. fbtft_device contains the display specific information.
     Show supported displays like this: sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=list; dmesg | tail -30
   * 'rotate' argument is now a conter clockwise angle: 0, 90, 180, 270
   * All drivers support all interface modes: SPI 8-bit + D/C, 8-bit + startbyte, 9-bit, GPIO 8, 16 bit (even though the LCD controller might not).
   * The drivers will also load automatically when the device is present (need only load fbtft_device).
   * The init sequence can be overridden on all drivers with the fbtft_device init argument.

   * fix stmpe-ts  
     Interrupts was missed resulting in driver hang
   * add rpi_power_switch module  
     Turn on/off the Raspberry Pi with a button
